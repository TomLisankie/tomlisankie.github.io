<p><em>The following is a poem sort of thing I wrote about a figure I saw over the summer who, to me, represented the devil.</em></p>

<p>This summer, I met the devil.<br />
He had tightly gelled back sugar brown hair, white skin like mine, and a shiny, toothy grin that never left his face.<br />
His entirety, hair, head, body, and all the rest was made of a hard plastic. Despite this, he didn&rsquo;t seem to suffer anatomically.<br />
He had a jaw a bit pointier than mine and was a little it shorter but we looked as if we could be related.<br />
Even though he was made entirely of plastic, it was the fact that he had no eyes that gave me unease.<br />
What would normally be creamy pools with centered, colored islands were instead jet black holes that led directly to the back of his fabricated skull.<br />
<br />
He began to approach me, at times struggling to keep his head (which was entirely too large for his body) upright. He wore a wrinkle-free three-piece that would traditionally be associated with the uptight.<br />
When he first spoke to me, it reminded me of how it used to sound when you tried to talk through your mask while trick-or-treating as a kid. The smile never moved from his face as he joked with me. He had a certain charm about him and told me that if I ever felt I needed advice, to come visit him at his office.<br />
And so I did, time and time again I visited him.<br />
<br />
He would tell me about the money was the most important thing. How the vanity was what you should absorb yourself in. Not code, not notes, not jokes. The appearance was all that mattered to him. It was hard not to let part of me fall for it. Anyway, he was always smiling why wouldn&#39;t he be trying to help me?<br />
<br />
But eventually I grew skeptical. I started trying to read him for myself. I started paying closer attention. To the echoes of his voice. To the fact that I couldn&#39;t tell his intention from his eyes or lack thereof.<br />
What did all of this mean in context?<br />
And I realized it. He was every Wall Street banker and corrupt congressman. He was part of the perpetual misery machine. He was the recruiter assigned to me, he was my own personal devil.<br />
<br />
But if he was the devil, who was god?<br />
I was. In my own flesh and blood, I was the one with the answers. I was god. Why had I been looking for advice and answers from someone who was totally empty? Echoed his own words internally as he spoke? Why? Because of his charisma? Because he always told me what I wanted to hear?<br />
He was not trying to help me right my wrongs. In fact, he was helping me write them.<br />
I needed to look inside of myself for answers. Myself, the one who was full of life. The one who had stretchable skin and internal organs, and a conscience. I was the one I needed to rely upon, not the empty.</p>

<h2 class="posttitle"><a href="rhyme-algorithm-inspiration" rel="bookmark">What Drew Me to Working with Rhymes and Lite Computational Phonology</a></h2>

<p>In high school, I discovered <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4FWvo9oS4gRgHtAwDwUjiO">The Black Album</a></em> by Jay Z. More specifically I had been listening to <em><a href="http://maxtannone.com/jaydiohead/">Jaydiohead</a></em> which I had been initially put onto (but had never really listened to in any sort of significant way) by a video from Ray William Johnson&#39;s vlog when I was in seventh or eighth grade and then decided to listen to the pure version of <em>The Black Album</em>.</p>

<p>I loved it. Jay Z was putting together these rhyme schemes that didn&#39;t <em>just</em> have flow and sound good but were also telling some sort of story/stories (also, I should note, about an environment that was essentially completely foreign to me which made it even more interesting) and also just bragging for the sake of it. I became fascinated with the fact that Jay was putting this together almost like a puzzle - creating a rhyme scheme with flow but also not sacrificing the story element.</p>

<p>As I continued through high school I thought &quot;what if I could create an algorithm that would compare words to one another and then suggest rhymes based on how similar they were.&quot; This question essentially birthed what all my personal project time has been dedicated to for the last two years or so and what has spawned my interest in computational linguistics with an integration of music theory (this is how I describe it anyway, it&#39;s possible that this is is a field that I don&#39;t know about. In which case, please tell me).</p>

<p>So, senior year I started to work on it. At first (I must have began in March of 2015) I was just picking apart songs and listing the words that rhymed, etc. so that I could try and see any patterns in the spelling of words that would allow for me to abstract in order to develop a method for comparing words. Granted, this didn&#39;t end up working since English doesn&#39;t exactly have a 1:1 grapheme (letter) to phoneme (sound) translation (for example, the word &quot;one&quot; is definitely not spelled as it sounds (w-uh-n)).</p>

<p>During the remainder of the school year, I sparsely worked on it but picked up working on it more over the summer. I had found a list of rules online for how one would generally go about translating specific strings of characters of sounds in many English words into their corresponding sounds. I spent a good amount of time at my local coffee shop (unfortunately just a Starbucks) translating these rules into pseudocode. Basically it would have just been a program that takes a giant list of English words and then outputs a phonemic translation of each word which I would then use as a database for the actual rhyme algorithm. Although I remember having all sorts of weird ideas about how I was actually going to store the phonemic translations such as putting it in some sort of XML tree structure which is by no means efficient as I found out later.</p>

<p>But then I decided to actually go online and google to see whether someone had, y&#39;know, <em>already done</em> this and whether it had been done well or not so I could see if I was wasting my time trying to reinvent the wheel. And lo and behold, I came across <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a> which had every word in the English language (many of which are completely useless and would never come up in any but the most obscure scenarios, but that&#39;s another story) along with that word&#39;s phonemic translation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet">ARPAbet</a>. This is exactly what I had been trying to do but even more efficiently so! This presented a bittersweet feeling for me though. Sweet because I no longer had to spend time trying to write a program that would produce this exact same result and could instead move on to the fun part of actually creating the rhyme algorithm. Bitter because I had just spent three weeks (obviously not every waking hour or anything, but definitely working on it here and there) wasting my time to try and create a database that already existed for free.</p>

<p>This taught me an important lesson though: whenever you&#39;re working on a project and you identify a piece of information, see if it&#39;s already been done so that you don&#39;t end up wasting your time. And the thing is, I did know this in the back of my head. But I had been preventing myself from looking up this information because I didn&#39;t want to bruise my own ego and feel as if I had been completely wasting my time and add to my fear of &quot;I&#39;ll never be able to create anything new because someone will always have gotten to it before me.&quot; But that&#39;s so counter-productive because why <em>wouldn&#39;t </em>I want to know if I had been wasting my time? Why wouldn&#39;t I want to move forward with my life and move on to better, more interesting things if I could? Knowing something is always better than not knowing something (there is rarely an exception to this when it comes to personal relationships, but that usually has more to do with obsessing over a piece of information about that person rather than simply just knowing it). And if that knowledge makes you sad, it can typically be remedied through applying a different attitude to the situation, focusing on something else, or doing something to change it.</p>

<p>Anyway, once I had this database I was free to actually develop the core of this whole endeavor which was (and to some extent still is) an algorithm for comparing the pronunciations of two words and then outputting a percentage of how similar their pronunciation is (aka how well they rhyme). I&#39;m not actually gonna describe the algorithm in this post (I completed the first working version of it in November 2015 and have been tweaking it on and off ever since), but I will in a future post once I have the app on the iOS App Store (after all, after I spent all this time on it, why would I want someone else to be the first to use it in a practical application).</p>

<h2 class="posttitle"><a href="first-post-and-why-ive-never-seriously-blogged-before" rel="bookmark">First Post and Why I&#39;ve Never Seriously Blogged Before</a></h2>

<p>I&#39;m constantly writing little notes on my iPhone that relate to things I&#39;ve been thinking about. They&#39;re usually not ever really fully formed thoughts or anything that would make sense to anyone else reading them without the context of the schema in my head, but they are some sort of structured thought nonetheless.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve never really blogged before. There&#39;s a few reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I don&#39;t like the idea of everyone knowing what I&#39;m thinking all the time.</li>
	<li>It takes so much effort to actually ellaborate on all these thoughts and communicate them clearly.</li>
	<li>It also takes time just to maintain a blog and regularly update. Sort of like having some sort of pet.</li>
</ol>

<p>But recently I&#39;ve been reading through a copy of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Who-Could-Change-World/dp/162097066X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473214572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=aaron+swartz">The Boy Who Could Change the World: The Writings of Aaron Swartz</a></em> that a friend gave me which, if you don&#39;t know, basically contains a bunch of stuff that <a href="http://aaronsw.com">Aaron Swartz</a> wrote in his short time here on Earth. Most of the content is Swartz&#39;s blog posts, some of it is transcripts from videos of him speaking, essays he wrote for books, etc. And reading through it has inspired me to take this up since the content which Swartz writes about is similar to what I&#39;d write about in a blog. He also has a very similar writing style to me. All of this combined makes me think &quot;oh, I can probably do this too&quot; especially since the idea of having my own little sort of &quot;island&quot; (website) on the Internet has always appealed to me ever since I was a little kid.</p>

<p>I have tried my hand at blogging before. At first it was on my first site that I made when I was in fourth grade called tomo285.com (it&#39;s a dead link, I let the service expire a long time ago. Named after my AIM screen name). I would mainly talk about Nintendo news as well as write these biographies of characters from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series. I eventually lost interest in this but I was pretty consistent about it and was getting a few hundred unique page views per month.</p>

<p>The second time I did some blogging was back before Shaken Earth was the name of my company and was instead just my online handle and the name of a blog I made in sixth grade. I had nearly no posts on it but it was mainly just updates on this program I was writing as I had taught myself Java called Phrasebot.</p>

<p>I think what was really inhibiting me previously from blogging was my feeling that each post had to be super well done and not just what was on my mind and ideas I had thinking about. I felt that each post had to be super complete. This makes sense given that I was recently diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">OCD</a>. And I&#39;ve sort of been coming to realize not even just recently but over the last year or two that that&#39;s not even a very great way to live.</p>

<p>But I also want to have a place on the web to spill my ideas and thoughts onto in long form in an environment that I effectively have full jurisdiction over.</p>

<p>So welcome to my blog. I&#39;ll think of a name as I continue adding posts, but for now it&#39;s unnamed.</p>
